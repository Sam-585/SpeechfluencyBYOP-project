# SpeechfluencyBYOP-project
PROBLEM STATEMENT: SPEECH DISABLED PEOPLE-PEOPLE HAVING STUTTERING AND
STAMMERING ISSUES HAVE DIFFERENT WORDS PER MIN IN EACH SENTENCE. THEY TAKE
DIFFERENT TIMES TO FINISH EACH SENTENCE AND ALSO USE A LOT OF FILLER WORDS
WHILE SPEAKING.


OBJECTIVE: MY GOAL IS TO CALCULATE THE WORDS PER MIN, NUMBER OF FILLER WORDS
USED, REPETITIONS OF THESE FILLER WORDS,TIME TAKEN TO FINISH A PARTICULAR
SENTENCE AND REPRESENT IT IN A GRAPHICAL WAY TO SHOW DISABLED PEOPLE, ON
WHAT ASPECTS THEY HAVE TO FOCUS TO IMPROVE THEIR SPEECH.
METHODOLOGY: 

1.I HAVE USED A PRE-TRAINED MODEL- OPENAI WHISPER FOR THE
EFFICIENT WORKING OF MY PROJECT.

2. CONVERTED TEXT TO SPEECH USING “TRANSCRIBE FUNCTION”.(INBUILT FUNCTION).
   
3. CALCULATED THE TIME ELAPSED(TRANSCRIPTION TIME).
   
4. CALCULATED WORDS PER MINUTE.
   
5. CALCULATED THE FILLER WORDS USED AND ITS REPETITIONS.
   
6. CODE FOR GENERATING WARNINGS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY ARE GOING WRONG.
 
8.USED THE “WORD CLOUD” LIBRARY TO GENERATE THE GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF
THESE.

9. “ FLASK FRAMEWORK” FOR THE FRONT END.


RESULTS: MY PROJECT EFFECTIVELY ANALYZED SPEECH PATTERNS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH
STUTTERING AND STAMMERING ISSUES, CALCULATING METRICS LIKE WORDS PER
MINUTE, FILLER WORDS, REPETITIONS, AND SENTENCE COMPLETION TIME. GRAPHICAL
REPRESENTATIONS AND ACTIONABLE FEEDBACK WERE PROVIDED THROUGH A USERFRIENDLY INTERFACE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS FOCUS ON IMPROVING THEIR SPEECH
FLUENCY.
